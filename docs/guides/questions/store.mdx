# Store answers

CliNext can use stored answers automatically for you. Simply turn the ```storeValue``` parameter to ```true``` and ```loadFromStoreOnInit``` to ```true```.
## Example
We want to ask questions depending on the type of engine the user chooses. 
The questions are available on our server with a GET request.

```js
export default ({
  _clinextType: 'command',
  ...
  questions: [
    {
      name: 'registryUsername',
      storeValue: true,
      loadFromStoreOnInit: true,
      storeDomain: CliNext.env.API_HOST
    }    
  ],
  ...
})
```

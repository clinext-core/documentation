# Quick Start ðŸš€

This quick start will use the @clinext/parse-server-engine engine.

### Step 1: Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Before you install CliNext, make sure to download and install Node.js (version 18.x or higher), a JavaScript runtime.
When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.


### Step 2: Docker (for local environment) 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
ðŸ‘‰ *Version 20.10.0 or above*
- Docker compose
ðŸ‘‰ *Version #TODO or above*

The easiest and recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

### Step 3: Install the CliNext CLI
The CliNext Command Line Interface 
<BashTabs npm={`npm install -g @clinext/cli`} />

### Step 4: Create a new CliNext app 
Using the @clinext/parse-server-engine:
```bash
clinext app new -q
```
The CliNext app has a dedicated system docker-compose for local development that will start a mongodb database, a Parse Server dashboard, a Redis cache database and a Redis Live Query server.

### Step 5: Add your own model
```bash
clinext model add
```

Models definition are stored in the app/schema folder.

### Step 6: Start the server
<BashTabs npm={`npm run start`} />

At this point the local CliNext docker compose has been launched and you can access
- The **API endpoint** at [http://localhost:1387/clinext](http://localhost:1387/clinext)
- The **Parse Server Dashboard** at [http://localhost:4080](http://localhost:4080) (username: admin, password: PASSWORD_TO_CHANGE)
- The **Minio ui endpoint** at [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) (username: MINIO_USERNAME_TO_CHANGE, password: MINIO_PASSWORD_TO_CHANGE)

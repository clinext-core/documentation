# Anatomy of a CliNext app

## Project structure
```bash
├── index.js
├── app
├── ├── ...
├── features
├── ├── ...
├── clinext.config.js
├── .env
└── package.json
```

- The clinext config is clinext.config.js
- The clinext app entry point is index.js
- The app feature is in /app

# Anatomy of a feature

Any feature respects the following root folder structure:

```bash
┌── main.js
├── target
├──── class
├──── triggers
├── schema
├── config
├── models
├── jobs
├── seed
├── services
├── lib
├── assets
├── docs
├── livemodels.js
└── main.json
```


## System design of a full-fledged local clinext app
A fully functional clinext deployment will use a few other components to run alongside a main clinext app.
These components are installed and run automatically when using the quick start CLI command.
They are defined in the app feature system's docker-compose file.

# Example

This example will walk you through the building of a fully functional clinext app.
The source code is available at [https://github.com/clinext-community/sample](https://github.com/clinext-community/sample)

We want to build a CliNext app that:
- #TODO

## 1. Install the generator

<BashTabs npm={"npm install -g generator-clinext"} />

## 2. Generate a new server

Generate a new clinext app by running the command:

```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
yo clinext -q -t app -n "MyApp"
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

You will be prompted to enter the basic informations needed to start a full-fledged clinext app.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run clinext.

## 3. Start your server

Run the development server:

<BashTabs yarn={"yarn start"} />

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created clinext-parse app, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `yarn start` command builds your app locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:1391/.


You can now open the CliNext dashboard at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) and view your application data.

:::info
Note that contrarily to Parse Server Dashboard, CliNext Dashboard does not permit class creation and modification via the UI. 
This is to enforce the unique ability of CliNext to predict schema and handle migrations automatically, thus avoiding environment discrepancies.
The sole source of truth is the features designated schema files.
:::

## 4. Add a class

At this point the app is fully functional but lacks any high level behavior.
By default a CliNext app contains the following models: *_User, _Session, _Installation, CliNextApp*
Add a custom class:

```bash
yo clinext -q -t class -n "BlogPost"
```

:::note
You can add class manually by adding a class payload to the app/schema/1.0.0/index.json
:::

Restart the app to reflect the changes:
<BashTabs yarn={"yarn stop \nyarn start"} />

## 5. Add features

We want to make:
- The app (thus clinextApp class) able to send notifications and emails, have a reference for countries, locales and currency 
```bash
yo clinext -q -t communityfeature --useAppFeature --targetClassName CliNextApp --feature notifiable
```

- The user (thus _User class) be followable, slugable, avatarable, localable, countryable
```bash
yo clinext -q -t communityfeature --useAppFeature --targetClassName _User --feature notifiable
```

- A blog post (thus BlogPost class) to be commentable, reviewable, publishable, localable, countryable, slugable
We want to Add a community feature to the CliNextApp to give it 
```bash
yo clinext -q -t communityfeature --useAppFeature --targetClassName BlogPost --feature notifiable
```
At this point the app is useful for blogging.

Restart the app to reflect the changes:
<BashTabs yarn={"yarn stop \nyarn start"} />


# Uninstall

<BashTabs npm={"npm uninstall -g generator-clinext"} />

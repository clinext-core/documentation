# Security

CliNext inherits the strong security features of Parse Server.

https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security

Parse Server uses two mechanisms mainly for ensuring data access security and restriction at the server level:
- Object-Level Access Control
- Class protection

CliNext makes it easy to edit and audit a feature's security as the class protection, generic ACLs and protected fields are statically defined in the schema files.

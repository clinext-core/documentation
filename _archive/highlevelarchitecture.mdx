# System design

CliNext is a Node JS template that helps orchestrate features and their respective models for the entire lifecycle of a server.
CliNext is built on top of Parse Server and Express JS with the intention to handle features along the features Parse Server already serves.
CliNext at its core is a template that works hand in hand with the clinext-engine which handles all the heavy lifting of registering features, computing models and their schemas, handling migrations and more.

## Components
- An Express app
- A Parse Server instance

CliNext exclusively uses ES modules.

## Boot process

When the server is launched, the clinext-engine performs the following tasks:

- Launches an Express app
- Computes the target database schema by aggregating the custom app tables and the features applied to those tables
- Checks if a schema migration is necessary. It migrates the schema or not accordingly
- Binds every feature to the events triggered by the tables that use them
- Exposes every feature custom function
- Registers jobs


## App stack

<div className={'bg-red-200 flex p-8'}>
<SVGComponent 
Svg={require('./appstack.svg').default} 
className={`w-full`} 
role="img" />
</div>

### Node JS

### Express JS

### Parse Server

## System design

A clinext deployment will use a few other components to run alongside a main clinext app.

<SVGComponent 
Svg={require('./components.svg').default} 
className={`w-full`} 
role="img" />
